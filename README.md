# Typewriter Effect in Java

Welcome to the **Typewriter Effect** project! This repository contains a simple Java program that simulates a typewriter effect, where text appears one character at a time, just like it's being typed in real-time.

## Features
- Simulates the typewriter effect in the console.
- Configurable speed for the typing effect.
- Easy to integrate into any Java application.

## How It Works
The program prints each character of a given string with a delay between them, mimicking the effect of typing on a typewriter. You can customize the speed of the typing animation and the text that is displayed.
